# ZTH1-Forth
Forth cross-compiler for the ZTH1 computer

This is a Forth language cross-compiler running under Linux and producing .mif files for the ZTH1 computer. It includes an "OS" consisting of a a library of base routines (arithmetic, text display...) written in assembly language. 

This cross-compiler is currently under test. A bona-fide bug-free version, as well as documentation and example files will be uploaded later in this repository.
